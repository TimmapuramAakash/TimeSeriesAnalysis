# TimeSeriesAnalysis

Aim:
      Stock values of a company for the precise dates are given.
      Using the algorithm forecast the stock values for the next required days.
      Accuracy is calculated by using cross_validation function from Prophet package.
      
     This helps to balance risk, purse benefits and  minimize losses

It is a supervised learning technique (predict by known dataset) 

Prediction of data using Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Prophet package is a additive regression model uses ARIMA  implemented in Stan’s probabilistic programming language and estimate using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. 

Prophet package has features for finding Seasonal and Holiday effects,Outliers,Trend change points etc which increases accuracy. 

Function used y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t ) +ε  where g(t) is linear regression function,s(t) is seasonal and h(t) is holiday effect function.

Packages required:
1)Matplotlib
2)Numpy
3)Plotly
4)Prophet
5)Pandas
